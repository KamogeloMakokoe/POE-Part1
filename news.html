    <h1>WHY DID WE CHOOSE MATHEMATICS?
    </h1>
    <p>Mathematics is believed to be the hardest subject for learners. Reason being ,learners often want to find the fastest way of tackling methods without understanding the methods. They end up cheating on exams, assignment and take-home tests. They are unable to deal with pressure and they end up failing and dropping out of school.Maths is one of the most important subject at school as it is required in order to pass a year and is also necessary for many careers(et al BrightSparks Tutors).Maths Guru is here to give your child a chance to reach their goal.We have worked with over 86000 learners and 50000 students in the world.

    <p>“Why do children dread mathematics? Because of the wrong approach. Because it is looked at as a subject”- Shakuntala Devi
